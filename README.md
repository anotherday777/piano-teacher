# Virtual Piano Teacher

## Overview

### What is the purpose of this project?
- To create a 1-2 octave virtual piano that teaches it's user snippets of classical/baroque music. 

### What is an octave?
- This is best ansnwered by the wiki page on Octave
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave

### Why classical/baroque  music?
- The music is often free of copyright such J.S Bach's Prelude in C Major (link below), sometimes well known from movies/commericals. This particular piece is from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, considered one of the most important works in keyboard history.

- Depending on the piece, it can show someone new to this era/period of music that a lot of emotion and feeling can created from playing just 3-4 notes like shifting just one note a step up or down of those 3-4 notes can change the mood from joy to melancholy. 

### Why snippets?

- As this is not a real piano/keyboard but virtual, the user will be using either their mouse or computer keyboard to play/interact. It's entertaining for the user for 1 minute this way, for 3/4 minutes it would tedious. 

### Why did I choose this topic for project no. 2?
- Music, specifically the piano, has been a part of my life from a young age. At the age of 7/8, my mom started teaching me the piano she had learned as a child on the same piano she grew up on, that my cousins of the next generation are now learning the piano on (three generations and counting!).

- From lessons my mom gave me and my brother, I then went on to study general music as my optional subject for my leaving certificate and then choose music as part of undergraduate BA.

1. Can CSS grid be used to make the virtual piano of black and white keys?
-Yes, this video shows it being done in flexbox but can be adapted to CSS grid.
